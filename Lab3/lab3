a) Instances:    14

b) ~ 63% class = yes ; ~38% = no given no evidence 

c) There are 2 instance of outlook = sunny & class = yes
   there are 3 instances of outlook = sunny & class = no 
	need to add one two each to deal with attribute class combinations 
	with zero instances in training data to avoid 0 prob 

       2+1 = 3 
       3+1 = 4

d) there are 9 instances of class = yes
   there are 5 instances of class = no 

there are 3 possible values for the attribute outlook  

	9+3 = 12
	5+3 = 8 

They are not 14 and 5 because that makes no sense 

e) Half of the the instance have class = yes
	given no evidence there is 50% class = yes (also 50% class = no)  


	outlook
  sunny           3.0   4.0
  overcast        1.0   1.0
  rainy           4.0   3.0
  [total]         8.0   8.0


there are still 2 instances of outlook = sunny class = yes ; 3 of outlook = sunny class = no

but overcast now has 0 instances of class = yes OR class = no  
0+1 = 1
0+1 = 1


There are now 5  instances of class = yes
and 5 instances  of class = no
 
5+3 = 8
5+3 = 8

They create the same rule set they are equally accurate

Although cross validation seems to give worse accuracy given new test data will probably perform better because just using training data  without CV can lead to over fitting to the training data.
